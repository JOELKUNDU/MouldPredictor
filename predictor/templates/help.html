<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Injection moulding is the most popular and widely used manufacturing process for the mass production of plastic products. In the process, a polymer is melted by electric and frictional heat and is injected into a metal mould under high pressure. The quality of the part produced is greatly influenced by process conditions. These process conditions can be changed by changing the machine parameters and is usually done by an experienced engineer. Whenever a new mould is created an engineer will experimentally determine the optimal parameters via repeated trials and visual inspection of the created product. This method is necessary as there is no theoretical method to predict the quality of the part produced given a set of machine parameters. This makes the process highly dependant on the knowledge and experience of the engineer which makes it hard to transfer the skill to a new operator. Wastage in the form of defective products, machine downtime, labour and energy also happen due to the experimental method. Another alternative to the experimental method is simulations. However, simulations are slow and computationally expensive.</p>
<p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence and is the area of computational science that focuses on analysing and interpreting pattern and structures in data to enable learning, reasoning and decision making outside of human interaction. Machine learning allows the user to feed a computer algorithm with a lot of data and have the computer analyse and make data-driven recommendations and decisions based on only the input data. Leveraging these benefits of machine learning, the author is designing a utility that can predict the optimal machine parameters as an output while taking mould geometry details, raw material properties and known process parameters as the inputs.</p>
<p>This utility will attempt to eliminate the experimental method currently being used. It will reduce the wastage and costs associated with the experimental method. This method will also be faster than both the experimental and simulation method. Also, the intuitive nature of the process will be eliminated allowing for less trained staff to easily control the machines.</p>
<p>This utility uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), that has been already trained on a mix of real and simulated data. The trained ANN predicts the weight of the final part produced based on a set of machine parameters given as input. To find the optimal machine parameters, the utility first finds the actual weight of the part by multiplying the mould volume and raw materialâ€™s density. Then the ANN cycles through all the possible machine parameters in a predefined range, predicting the part weight for each combination. The utility then outputs the optimal combination for which the predicted weight is greater or equal to the actual weight of the part.</p>

<h4 id="understanding-the-performance-of-the-ann-1">Understanding the performance of the ANN</h4>
<p>To view the performance of the ANN, the user has to open the <strong>Model</strong> tab from the navigation bar on the top of the screen. When the screen loads, The user would be presented with a scatter plot ( Predicted weights vs Actual Weights ). The closer the scatters are to the diagonal of the chart, the better is the performance of the model. Below the plot, three performance metrics are shown.</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolute Mean Error ( lower the better )</li>
<li>Maximum Error ( lower the better )</li>
<li>Model Performance Score ( higher the better )</li>
</ul>
<p>The performance of the model can be increased by regularly retraining the ANN on the expanding database.<br>
The performance of the model can also be increased by occasionally hypertunning the model. However significant improvement might not happen after the first few uses of this tool</p>
<h4 id="retrain-the-model-1">Retrain the model</h4>
<p>Retraining the model allows the ANN to improve its performance by learning from the new data added to the database. To retrain the ANN the user has to follow the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>The user has to open the <strong>Model</strong> tab from the navigation bar on the top of the screen</li>
<li>The user has to scroll down to the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>The user has to click on the button labelled <strong>Retrain the model</strong></li>
<li>This user can observe the process happening in the terminal window that opens along with the utility</li>
<li><strong>NOTE</strong>: This process will take time.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hypertuning-the-model-1">HyperTuning the Model</h4>
<p>Hyper-Parameter tuning allows the model to tweak its setting automatically to better perform on the given dataset. This utility is fully automatic and requires no input from the user. To HyperTune the model, the user has to follow the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>The user has to open the <strong>Model</strong> tab from the navigation bar on the top of the screen</li>
<li>The user has to scroll down to the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The user has to click on the button labelled <strong>Auto-HyperTune the model</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This user can observe the process happening in the terminal window that opens along with the utility</li>
<li><strong>NOTE</strong>: This process will take time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getting-help-1">Getting Help</h3>
<p>To resolve any issue related to how one can use the utility, the user can refer to the manual that is present in the <strong>Help</strong> tab in the navigation bar.</p>
<p>To get information about the code the user simply has to search the function name in the manual present <a href="{{ url_for( 'documentation' ) }}">here</a> file to get details about the function or python script file.</p>
